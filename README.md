## Features
- **Tree Structure Visualization**: Visualize hierarchical data in a tree format using SVG for better interactivity and scalability.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Navigate through the tree structure using keyboard shortcuts for an enhanced user experience.
- **Tree Editing**: Edit node labels, add child nodes, and delete nodes with intuitive controls.
- **Export/Import JSON**: Easily export the current tree structure as JSON and import existing structures.

## Implementation Details
1. **Tree Structure**: The tree will be implemented using a class that represents nodes with properties for labels and children. Methods will be included for adding, deleting, and navigating nodes.
  
2. **Graphics**: SVG will be used for rendering the tree due to its advantages in handling interactive graphics and responsiveness.

3. **Editing Functionalities**: Users can edit node labels inline or through a modal. Keyboard shortcuts will facilitate quick actions, and confirmation prompts will ensure safe deletions.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
3. Use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate and edit the tree structure.
